    "The purpose of this notebook was to take care of weird strikes that are in `option_price` and hence made their way into `otm_history`.  It seems to be that QQQ has strikes at an 1/8 of a dollar, or 0.125. However, some of these seem to round to e.g. 75.83 (instead of 75.825).  This was causing issues because of a lack of an exact match (for some reason, probably because I am using `real` data type in my postgres database) when creating the `option_pnl_history`.  So I decided to just remove all these problematic strikes."
